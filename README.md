### about me
I'm a fourth-year Engineering Physics student at the University of British Columbia with a focus on Electrical Engineering. I enjoy solving complex problems that require a foundational knowledge of physics and engineering

My interests span fusion energy, metagenomic sequencing, AI and more. I've interned at [SanctuaryAI](https://sanctuary.ai/), [General Fusion](https://generalfusion.com/), [Yachie Lab](https://yachie-lab.org/), [Cambridge's Existential Risk Initiative](https://www.camxrisk.org/), and several other organizations.
