### about me
I'm a fourth-year Engineering Physics student at the University of British Columbia with a focus on Electrical Engineering. I enjoy solving complex problems that require a foundational knowledge of physics and engineering

My interests span fusion energy, metagenomic sequencing, AI and more. I've interned at Visit SanctuaryAI, General Fusion, Yachie Lab, Cambridge's Existential Risk Initiative, and several other organizations. [Resume]()

I aspire to build groundbreaking technologies that help humanity advance and flourish.
